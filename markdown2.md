Hello world

How did I build this website?

I built this website using Visual Studio Code, and GitHub, and the internal functions are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and one API to initiate a personal workplace focused on fashion and style. I created a folder in a suitable location on my computer and I opened it with Visual Studio Code. The format of my website started with a standers HTML template <!DOCTYPE html> and the <html> element with the lang="en" attribute. Inside the <head> section, I wrote down the code UFT-8 to configure the viewpoint for responsive design. I titled the page named LORE.S and linked external resource, for instance, Google font to style the letters and created a file named style.css for the page’s visual design. I also included markdown.md, cript.js enable the dynamic rendering of Markdown content directly within the browser.
The body section starts with a beautiful engaging section, which introduce visitors with a welcoming message saying “Welcome to my fashion world, Lore.s” 
I used a <div> with the class hero to placing this headings in front a background image through CSS. To ensure the text remains readable against the image, I layered a semi-transparent overlay on top of the background using the ::before pseudo-element.
The text itself is styled with a combination of a serif font for the brand name and bold colors to make it visually appealing. I also positioned the headings relative to the overlay layer using z-index to ensure proper layering and visibility.
Under the hero section, I added a paragraph that describes my purpose of the website and emphasizes fashion brand. This is followed by three images displayed with specific widths and heights to maintain a consistent layout and visual balance. Each image includes an alter attribute for accessibility and better SEO, describing the content as “Your style.”
To make my website interactive, I created two buttons that allow audiences to load content directly from markdown files. Additionally, each button changes the background color of the website to provide visual feedback and create a distinct experience for each page.
A key interactive feature is random quote displayed on the front page. I wrote an asynchronous JavaScript function that bring quotes from the quotable API. When the page starts, this function runs automatically and updates the content of the <P> element with the ID quote. If the API request fails for any reason, a fallback quote is displayed to ensure the site always has content. The quote also has error handling to log any issues to encounter the fetch process. 
The CSS file defines the visual style of the website. I added a base background color, text alignment. Font style, and margins. Headings and paragraphs have customized font size, colors, and spacing to make the content attractive and make a good first impression. Buttons are styled with a consistent color scheme, rounded corners, padding, and hover effects to improve usability and aesthetics. The hero section includes a background image, text alignment, padding, and a layered semi-transparent overlay, as well as specific z-index values to ensure the text appears above the overlay. The brand name uses a distinct Google Font to reinforce the visual identity of the site. The quote section is styled with italicized text, a slightly smaller font size, and a subdued color to differentiate it from the main content.
Overall, this website is a combination of structural HTML, visually appealing CSS, and interactive JavaScript functionality. It demonstrates how a beginner can create a website and play with its outlook. I struggled a lot to create the codes, so I borrowed it from Google and ChatGPT.  Our class presentations also did a great help to order this codes in HTML. Finally, by combining responsive design principles, layered styling techniques, and asynchronous data fetching, I created a website that not only showcases fashion visually but also engages users through interactive content, making it a polished and personalized first project built entirely from scratch.
